Who am I?

My name is Ruhama and I recently graduated from Syracuse with a B.S. in Information Management and Technology. I am a Frontend Web Developer invested in all granular aspects of website building. I am a storyteller that deeply cares about the user experience of a digital platform. A website is a company's first impression, so let's make a good one!

Current Location 

I'm currently working at Civilience as a React Frontend Developer.


Latest Project

Is it a bird, is it a plane.....nope! Just a pen. 
I just completed building the project which is really a script to automate my discovery of new Amharic words to aid my learning. I took the opportunity to practice some Three.js by ading some UI.
