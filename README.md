### Thanks for stopping by 🤸‍♀️

**Who am I?**

My name is Ruhama and I recently graduated from Syracuse with a B.S. in Information Management and Technology. I am a Frontend Web Developer invested in all granular aspects of website building. I am a storyteller that deeply cares about the user experience of a digital platform. A website is a company's first impression, so let's make a good one!

**Current Location: 👩‍💼**

I'm currently working at Civilience as a React Frontend Developer.


**Latest Project:**

Is it a bird, is it a plane.....nope! Just a pen. 🖋️

I just completed building a project by the name Poem-mehcanic. It is a script to automate my discovery of new Amharic words to aid my learning of my native tongue. I took the opportunity to practice some Three.js by ading some UI. Check it out here and read the README where I shed some light on the motive and the next iterations I am planning:
