Who am I?
My name is Ruhama and I recently graduated from Syracuse with a B.S. in Information Management and Technology. I am a Frontend Web Developer invested in all granular aspects of website building. I am a storyteller that deeply cares about the user experience of a digital platform. A website is a company's first impression, so let's make a good one!

Current Location: 
I'm currently working at Civilience as a React Frontend Developer.
